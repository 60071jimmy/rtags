Shared memory
Fix writing of references/cursors to "db", probably should just write all cursors first, then merge in all references.
We should sort output from C-x r / with definitions first (like symbolName)
We're having make issues with at least directfb and openssl, for the
latter eatAutoTools is not doing the right thing.
Forward declarations are not references to classes

Still at least one problem with constructors:

struct F
{
F();
F(const F &f) {}
};

int main()
{
    F f = F();
}

somehow the F() call refers to the struct F, not the default
constructor, also, f does not refer to the copy constructor.

Trying to improve the current hacks in origin/workonstupidconstuctor
