Shared memory
Fix writing of references/cursors to "db", probably should just write all cursors first, then merge in all references.
fork make
Still problems with constructors. At least implicitly converted ones.

E.g.

class Balle 
{
public:
    Balle(int);
};

...

Balle b = 12;

12 is a reference to Balle(int) and has symbolLength of 5.
