Consider waiting for currently processing files before queries on these files
Consider changing offsets in currently modified files the same way compilation mode does
Consider not actually removing entries from db until a file has
   actually successfully parsed.
Consider not calling /usr/bin/cpp to find paths but rather cache them
   based on the path to the compiler used.
