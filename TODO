Consider waiting for currently processing files before queries on these files
Consider changing offsets in currently modified files the same way compilation mode does
Consider not actually removing entries from db until a file has
   actually successfully parsed.
Consider not calling /usr/bin/cpp to find paths but rather cache them
   based on the path to the compiler used.
Use the same pch file for rc/rdm/shared
When a variable is also a call to a constructor we're not doing the
   rightr thing about find references. For an example just do
   find-references on QList<QByteArray> split in GccArguments::parse.
