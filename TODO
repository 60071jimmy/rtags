Consider waiting for currently processing files before queries on these files
Consider changing offsets in currently modified files the same way compilation mode does
Use the same pch file for rc/rdm/shared
Maybe clang has some gcc compat mode where it would work approriately with the
   headers from the toolchain
Solve constructors and destructors for rename symbol.
Use GccArguments in rdm as well
When a file has disappared it never gets out of the database
