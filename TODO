Shared memory
Fix writing of references/cursors to "db", probably should just write all cursors first, then merge in all references.
We should sort output from C-x r / with definitions first (like symbolName)
We're having make issues with at least directfb and openssl, for the
latter eatAutoTools is not doing the right thing.

### usage bugs

1)
Forward declarations are not references to classes

2)
Still at least one problem with constructors:

struct F
{
F();
F(const F &f) {}
};

int main()
{
    F f = F();
}

somehow the F() call refers to the struct F, not the default
constructor, also, f does not refer to the copy constructor.

Trying to improve the current hacks in origin/workonstupidconstuctor

3)
Some template issue. Can't follow this symbol in Connection.h:

template<typename T> bool Connection::send(const T *message)
{
     return send(...
}            /\
             ||


The kqueue and fsevents watchers both have an issue where if you watch /foo,
then /foo/bar and then unwatch /foo then none of the paths are watched.
In addition, the kqueue watcher has an issue where if you watch /foo/bar,
then watch /foo and then unwatch /foo, then /foo/bar is no longer watched either.
