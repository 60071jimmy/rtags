Consider waiting for currently processing files before queries on these files
Consider changing offsets in currently modified files the same way compilation mode does
Maybe clang has some gcc compat mode where it would work approriately with the
   headers from the toolchain
Solve constructors and destructors for rename symbol.
When a file has disappared it never gets out of the database
do eventsource from rdm to emacs
we break on dos line endings. We could solve this by using
   line/col when emacs has converted the line endings. rc needs to
   understand lines columns

we may have to handle CXCursor_ClassTemplatePartialSpecialization and
   maybe some other kinds that we currently.

check in various build systems so we can easily test them:

directfb, openssl, qmake-based, cmake-based, scons, automake (directfb?)
reintroduce a -m option that waits for it to finish indexing
make -g work when we start rdm using -a, I don't think it currently does
