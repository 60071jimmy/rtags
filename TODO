Consider waiting for currently processing files before queries on these files
Consider changing offsets in currently modified files the same way compilation mode does
Consider not actually removing entries from db until a file has
   actually successfully parsed.
Use the same pch file for rc/rdm/shared
When a variable is also a call to a constructor we're not doing the
   right thing about find references. For an example just do
   find-references on QList<QByteArray> split in GccArguments::parse.
