Shared memory
Fix writing of references/cursors to "db", probably should just write all cursors first, then merge in all references.
fork make
We should sort output from C-x r / with definitions first (like symbolName)
Still at least one problem with constructors:

struct F
{
F();
F(const F &f) {}
};

int main()
{
    F f = F();
}

somehow the F() call refers to the struct F, not the default
constructor, also, f does not refer to the copy constructor.

Trying to improve the current hacks in origin/workonstupidconstuctor
