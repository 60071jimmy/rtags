Consider waiting for currently processing files before queries on these files
Consider changing offsets in currently modified files the same way compilation mode does
Use the same pch file for rc/rdm/shared
Maybe clang has some gcc compat mode where it would work approriately with the
   headers from the toolchain
Make a string wrapper class and use that one for mHeaderHash.
Solve constructors and destructors for rename symbol.
Delay dirtying if dirty file has no dependencies (except itself)
