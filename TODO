Make rtags -u|--update
Make rtags create rtags.db (-o | or default to .rtags.db in same dir as Makefile).
Add filenames, lastModified, dependencies, GccArguments etc to rtags.db
Look into short-circuiting when encounting a header we have seen before in VisitThread
add a string class around CXString
we need to listen for leaving directory and maintain a stack in FileManager
implement a symbol at current pos which could be used for a dynamic modeline thing for emacs
nicer output from rbuild
